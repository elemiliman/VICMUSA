	        	VINEYARD INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN MINISTRIES, INC. (hereinafter called
				the "Ministry") was incorporated under the Religious Corporation Laws of
				the State of New York. The said Ministry adopted the following Articles
				and Bylaws to govern the Ministry and other local Ministries. We consider
				the Scriptures of the Holy Bible as the final authority for our
				Articles of Faith, Salvation and Practice. The Ministry welcomes into
				Christian Fellowship every other Local Ministry and their members as one
				in the Body of Christ. However, in order to maintain unity of purpose
				and consistent testimony to the community, the registered Ministry has
				established certain articles of Faith and Practice, conditions and

	        	<p>We believe there is but one living and true God, sovereign,
					everlasting, of infinite power, wisdom and goodness, the maker and
					preserver of all things, visible and invisible. And in the unity of
					the Godhead there are three persons of one substance, power and
					eternity, the Father, The Son (the word) and the Holy Spirit. 205.
					Jesus Christ: We believe in Jesus Christ, the second person of the
					Triune Godhead, that He was eternally one with the Father, that He
					became incarnate by the Holy Spirit and was born of the virgin Mary,
					and became the God-man, suffered, crucified, died and buried and rose
					again the third day and He ascended into Heaven and is there engaged
					in intercession for us.</p>
		
				<p>
					<strong>The Holy Spirit:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>We believe in the Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father and
					the Son, the third person of the Triune Godhead, and He is ever
					present and effectively active in and with the Ministry of Christ,
					convincing the world of Sin, regenerating those who repent and
					believe, sanctifying believers and guiding them into all truth as it
					is in the Jesus and the Word of God.</p>
		
				<p>
					<strong>The Holy Scriptures:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>We believe that the Holy Scriptures, the sixty-six books of the
					Old and New Testaments, to be given divine inspiration, superior to
					all human authority, and inherently revealing the will of God in all
					things necessary to our Salvation, so that whatever is not contained
					therein is not to be enjoined as an Article of Faith.</p>
		
				<p>
					<strong>The Ministry of Jesus Christ:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>We believe in the Ministry of Jesus Christ, visible and invisible
					local and universal, militant and triumphant with unity in diversity
					and in co-operative effort with other local Ministries and
					congregations. We believe that Jesus Christ, through the Holy Spirit
					is building his Ministry as a body of believers on earth.</p>
		
				<p>
					<strong>Ground for Salvation:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>The ground for salvation is that through Jesus Christ, by His
					sufferings, by His shedding of His own Blood, by His meritorious
					death on the cross, and by His burial and resurrection, made full
					atonement for the sins of all human beings from Adam to the last man
					on earth. 230. The Gospel Ministry: We believe in proclaiming the
					full ministry of the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. The
					proclamation of the gospel is, as Jesus said to His disciples and to
					all of us in Mark Chapter 16 and verse 15-16, "Go ye into all the
					World and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and
					is baptized shall be saved."</p>
		
				<p>
					<strong>Faith:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>We believe that living faith is the gift of God, and without
					it, it is impossible to please God, and furthermore that faith
					enables the saved to live justly in this present world and thus to
					please God.</p>
		
				<p>
					<strong>Repentance: Justification, and Adoption.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					We believe that repentance, justification and adoption are
					simultaneous in experience of a seeker after God and are obtained
					upon the condition of faith in the merits of the shed blood of Jesus
					Christ, accompanied by repentance and that the Holy Spirit bears
					witness to this grace.<br> <strong>A.</strong> We believe that repentance is a
					sincere and thorough change of mind in regard to sin, involving a
					sense of personal guilt and a voluntary turning away from and
					forsaking of sin. We believe that repentance is demanded of all who
					have by act or purpose become sinners against God. The Spirit of God
					gives to all who repent the gracious help of penitence of heart and
					hope of mercy that they may believe unto pardon and spiritual life.
					We believe that regeneration, or the new birth is that gracious work
					of God whereby the moral nature of the penitent believer is
					spiritually quickened and given a distinctively spiritual life,
					capable of faith, love and obedience.<br> <strong>B.</strong> We believe that
					adoption is that act of God by which the regenerated believer is
					constituted a child of God.<br> <strong>C.</strong> We believe that justification
					is the gracious and judicial act of God by which He grants full
					pardon of all guilt, complete release from penalty of sins committed
					and acceptance.
				</p>
		
				<p>
					<strong>The Gifts and Power of the Holy Spirit:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>We believe that all believers need the working power of the
					Holy Spirit in their lives and that the gifts of the Holy Spirit as
					are supernaturally endowed for service are determined by the faith
					and character of every believer for the ministry to be fulfilled in
					the work of the Ministry. The gifts of the Spirit are exercised in
					conjunction with, and not apart from, the harmony of the body of
					Christ.</p>
		
				<p>
					<strong>Sanctification:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>We believe sanctification to be that act of God, subsequent to
					regeneration, by which believers are made free from carnal and
					depraved sin of the heart and life, by which believers are filled
					with the Holy spirit; by which believers are empowered to live holy
					unto the Lord and by which the fruits of the Spirit as in Galatians
					5:22-24 are manifested and are brought into a state of entire
					devotion to God and the holy obedience of perfect love. We believe
					also that the Christian thus sanctified and filled with the Holy
					spirit and having a purified heart, mind and motive and living
					victoriously over sin, is still capable of human error and
					misjudgment but that every believer should expect and seek to grow
					and make progress in this grace and maturing in this grace and
					becoming more like the Master in Word and deed.</p>
		
				<p>
					<strong>Second Coming,Resurrection, Judgment &amp; Destiny:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ will come again to
					receive His children unto Himself and to judge the quick and the
					dead. We believe in the resurrection of the dead, that the bodies
					both of the just and the unjust shall be raised to life and united
					with their spirits , that they that have done good unto resurrection
					of life, and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of
					damnation (John 5:29). We believe the scriptures to teach the bodily
					return of Christ to the earth and that He will cause the fulfillment
					of all prophecies made concerning his final and complete triumph over
					evil.</p>
		
				<p>
					<strong>Divine Healing:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					We believe in the bible doctrine of divine healing and urge our
					people to endeavor to the prayer of faith for the healing of the
					sick. Providential and medical means and agencies, when deemed
					necessary should not be refused. <br>We are to do good to the
					body and souls of men.
				</p>
		
				<p>
					<strong>Free Agency:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>We believe that the creation of human beings in Godlikeness
					included the ability to choose between right and wrong, and thus
					there were made morally responsible. That man will have to choose to
					believe on the Lord Jesus Christ for salvation or choose to reject
					Salvation and be dammed.</p>
		
				<p>
					<strong>Relative Duties:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>We believe those two great commandments of our Lord Jesus
					Christ which require us to love the Lord our God with all our Heart
					and our neighbors as ourselves contain the sum of the Divine Law as
					it is revealed in the Scriptures.</p>
		
				<p>
					<strong>Sacraments:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>We believe that the two main sacraments of the Christians
					Ministry are Baptism and the Lord's Supper which are essential
					requirements under the New Testament. Both sacraments are to be
					administered to believers as a declaration of their faith in Jesus
					Christ as their Savior.</p>
